        <h1><mark>BENEFITS OF DOING DAILY EXERCISES</mark></h1>
            <p> Regular exercise is vital for both physical health and mental well-being. Activities like walking, jogging, or cycling improve cardiovascular health, build strength, and increase flexibility. Exercise also releases endorphins, which reduce stress and boost mood. In our busy lives, even small efforts like daily workouts or taking the stairs can make a big difference. Staying active is essential for a healthier and happier life.</p>
